    "  \n",
    "On the first part of the Challenge called District Summary, we code to have initial insights. We can see, for example, that math is harder to pass than reading, with 74.9% and 85.8% passing percentages respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the next part of the Challenge called School Summary, we have a deeper dive into the data, where we can observe that the top 5 performing schools are Charter Type and the bottom 5 are District Type. We also can notice that the total number of students on the top 5 performing schools are significantly less than the total number of students on the bottom 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the following two parts of the challenge, called Math Scores by Grade and Reading score by grade we code to get the average note per school and by grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the last part of the challenge, we get 3 summary tables that show:\n",
    "1) Spending Ranges per student and its corresponding Math and Reading scores\n",
    "2) School Size and its corresponding Math and Reading scores\n",
    "3) School Type and its corresponding Math and Reading scores\n",
    "  \n",
    "CONCLUSIONS:\n",
    "\n",
    "1)\tMath is harder to pass than reading, with 74.9% and 85.8% passing percentages respectively.\n",
    "2)\tThe top 5 performing schools are Charter Type and the bottom 5 are District Type.\n",
    "3)\tThe total number of students on the top 5 performing schools are significantly less than the total number of students on the bottom 5.\n",
    "4)\tMath, Reading and Overall Passing Percentages are higher with lower spending ranges per student (this is a little counterintuitive in my opinion).\n",
    "5)\tLarge School Size have significantly lower overall passing rates.\n",
    "6)\tCharter Type Schools have significantly higher overall passing rates.\n"
